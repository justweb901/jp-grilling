  <!-- Here we have the header that holds the following HTML elements which is simply 
    content that our browser quickly renders onto the page 
   nav bar that holds an img tag which is the logo 
    that's wrapped around an anchor tag that links to index.html which is our default home page
   h2 header that is used for introducing new content like a title for example then a paragraph that goes into more depth about the title.
    With the h2 we have a span which is an inline element used specifically for stying our text J, P, and G within the h2 header in this case; JP Grilling
  ul which is used to store our list items that automatically come with bullet points, if I changed an unordered list to an order list our list items would be
    numbered instead.  And we have Home, Menu, Contact, and  we also have used a little bit of javascript that's been applied to our last list item My Plate to send an alert letting us know that this page does not exist yet
